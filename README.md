Test assessment at some company

Problem:
* You are given a Google Doc like this one that contains a list of Unicode characters and their positions in a 2D grid. Your task is to write a function that takes in the URL for such a Google Doc as an argument, retrieves and parses the data in the document, and prints the grid of characters. When printed in a fixed-width font, the characters in the grid will form a graphic showing a sequence of uppercase letters, which is the secret message.

Specifications:
* Your code must be written in Python (preferred) or JavaScript.
* You may use external libraries.
* You may write helper functions, but there should be one function that:
1. Takes in one argument, which is a string containing the URL for the Google Doc with the input data, AND
2. When called, prints the grid of characters specified by the input data, displaying a graphic of correctly oriented uppercase letters.

Input data:
